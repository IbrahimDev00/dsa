I am solving this by using a dictionary to store the indices of numbers we have seen so far. This approach allows us to check for the complement of each number in constant time.
1. Initialize an empty hashmap to store the indices of numbers.
2. Iterate through the array nums. For each number:
    .Calculate its complement (target - num).
    .Check if the complement exists in the hashmap.
    .If it does, return the indices of the current number and its complement from the hashmap.
    .If it doesn't, add the current number and its index to the hashmap.
