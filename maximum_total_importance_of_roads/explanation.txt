arr: An array of size n initialized to zero. This array will keep track of the number of roads connected to each city.
Iterate through each road represented by a pair [A, B].
For each road, increment the count for both cities A and B.
Sort the array arr in ascending order. After sorting, cities with fewer roads will be at the beginning, and cities with more roads will be at the end.
nitialize a variable sumation to store the total importance.
Iterate through the sorted array arr.
Multiply the number of roads for each city (arr[i]) by its assigned importance value (i + 1), and add this to sumation.
